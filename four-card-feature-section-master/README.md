## Overview

Took a break from FEM recently due to work commitments. This challenge was interesting as I wanted to practice grid layout which so far, I have not found many use cases for as I mainly use flexbox for layout solutions. Also, it gave me an opportunity to practive TailWind css which I need to get familiar with for work purposes. I added some TW class animations which were effortless to include. I didn't want to spend time dealing with setup and config, so I used the CDN link. I still needed to reset user agent styles with an imported plain css file.

Overall, the challenge took three to four hours from the briefing read through to first draft. This was mainly down to procrastination on whether the mobile to desktop design could be accomplished with flex or grid and then a lot of trial and error with grid layout.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

## My process

No deliberate plan of action with this one- just 5-10 mins conceptual model of the sections used to break up this design and consideration of the markup to follow.

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- TailWind css

### What I learned

Use Tailwind UI premade components library: they probably have markup that can reproduce the card sections and then tweak to suit the design.
Basic practice with grid but still need to gain familiarity.

### Continued development

Keep practicing using Tailwind, perhaps learn how to import, then purge the file so that only the styling used gets imported on build time.
Keep practicing grid especially for configurations that span rows or columns.

### Useful resources

- Tailwind docs, component library and playground demo site.
