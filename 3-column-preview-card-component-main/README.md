## Overview

- The aim of this challenge was to improve on speed of accuracy without compromising on quality: replicating the design template.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

Had a look at both mobile and desktop designs to plan the html tags required. The interactive elements are straightforward to implement. From the lessons learned from previous card component challenges, I went about rendering a parent container with sub-containers for the three topics of content and using box model to position the content. For the desktop version, I used flexbox to snap to rows and css:hover to alter the button styling.

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS (SASS)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Nothing new but I did improve on the turnaround (1.5hrs, shaving off about an hour to 1.5hrs compared to previous challenges!). This is probably due to the skills being fresh in the mind and this particular project was more straighforward: no image editing, less manipulation of individual margin and padding for each sub-container, manageable interactive elements. Where delay occurred was again on getting the content to be centered vertically and horizontally for both mobile and desktop, requiring some trial and error and tweaking the positioning of the paragraph text to match the template.
